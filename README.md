## Purpose and Motivation
# Why I made this:
I made this project to showcase what I have learned to do with python in regards to data analysis. I am a software engineer taking courses in data science to transition into a data scientist role.

# What Problem this solves:
This project takes real, raw medical data via a free data set on [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance) and performs some data analysis to find some useful insights.

# What did I learn:
I learned that coding in python is less frustrating than formatting markup language in a readme file.

# What makes my project stand out:
The clear documentation, the updated comments in the code and my furrious burning passion for revealing the truth with data.

# What's next?
Getting into the python library MatPlotLib to create some visual representations of the data and get some nice images into this readme is next.

## Project Description

# What does this project do?
This project uses python to import raw medical data from a .csv file and performs calculations on the data to reveal useful information.

## How to Install and Run
1. Download the repo
2. Make sure you have a code editor set up with a python environment. I use VS Code, this script should work on many different set ups.
3. Open the project folder in VS Code and navigate into root foler with your terminal.
    cd '.\Python Portfolio Project\'

4. Run script.py with python in the terminal
    python .\script.py

5. View the results printed into the terminal. You can open the script.py file in your editor to see the comments and the code.

## Credits
Travis Holter wrote the code.
The data come from a free data set on [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)
You are the beautiful human being who viewed and enjoyed this project. Thank you! I hope you have an excellent day.
